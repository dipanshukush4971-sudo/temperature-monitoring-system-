OVERVIEW : ARDUINO-BASED DIGITAL TEMPERATURE MONITORING

Objective:

To design and implement a real-time temperature monitoring system using an Arduino UNO and an analog temperature sensor (LM35). The system must accurately measure the ambient temperature, convert the analog sensor data into Celsius/Fahrenheit, and dynamically display the reading on an I2C Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).

Key Elements:

Temperature Sensor (LM35/DS18B20) – Acquires the analog or digital temperature data from the environment.
Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) – The Arduino's built-in function to convert the sensor's analog voltage output into a digital value.
Linear Conversion Logic – Firmware logic to convert the raw sensor reading (voltage) into a standard unit (e.g., degrees Celsius).
LCD Display (I2C) – Provides a low-power, visible interface to display the current temperature reading dynamically.
Arduino UNO – Serves as the microcontroller to read sensor data, execute the conversion algorithm, and manage the LCD output.

Technology Used:

Arduino UNO – Microcontroller platform for processing sensor inputs and driving the display.
LM35 Precision Temperature Sensor – An analog sensor providing a voltage output linearly proportional to the Celsius temperature.
I2C LCD Module (16x2) – Serial display interface requiring only two data wires (SDA and SCL) for communication.
Arduino IDE – Development environment for programming the microcontroller.# temperature-monitoring-system-
